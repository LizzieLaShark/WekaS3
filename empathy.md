tell us what you think of the idea of an empathic civilization. Is it possible? How would we work 
towards that goal? What stumbling blocks do you see? Is this something you believe is worth your 
time and effort to pursue? What are the possible downsides of pursuing it? Of not pursuing it? (15 minutes)

Empathy Civilisation:

I loved this video! Thank you for sharing it :)

As Rifkin says, an empathic civilisation is vital to the survival of mankind. I wholeheartedly agree with 
this. In fact, it seems to me that many of us are already aware of this, and that we see and feel on a base level 
that humans are inherently empathetic. My initial thought when I watched the video was 'Yay! Science is finally 
catching up to the rest of us!'

As such, I do believe that it is possible to achieve this globally, but it's a very hard slog. My fear of course 
(which comes from the perspective of someone who is worried about the state of our climate), is always: will we 
get there in time?

I think Rifkin really begins to hit the nail on the head when he talks about things like education, governance and 
business. It is my opinion that if we are ever to acheive any kind of just world, we need to tackle things at a very
systemic level. This does mean awakening the populace to our inherent empathy. It also means changing the economic
system we use, power distribution and dynamics and many other characteristics of our society that operate at a very
deep level.

Working towards this goal... I dont think anyone has 'the' correct answer to this. I find it obnoxious when 
activists (and others) go on at me about 'the real way to achieve change' even though I understand the emotional 
place this comes from. In fact, I experience it myself often though I choose not to vocalise it so as not to deterr 
people who really are trying to do good. I have wondered if aspects of agile management could be applied to our 
changemaking as it can be very condusive to innovation (and no, I dont mean innovation in the business sense!). 

Nation state empathy, look same, speak same language and only applicable comparitively, not in everyday life.
