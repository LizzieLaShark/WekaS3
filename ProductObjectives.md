Taranaki Energy Watch Website

The website will provide an online landing page for the group; offering information, a chance to get involved 
& inspiring a feeling of community commitment against fossil fuel extraction in Taranaki.

Objectives:

  -Provide an informative and inspiring landing pad for taranaki community to be able to cut through council 
  proapaganda & gain understanding of the dangers of fossil fuel extraction in their community.

  -Increase percieved power  - councils and fossil fuel companies understand that the opposition is quite large and 
  is organised. Experienced grassroots activists (rather than what it currently looks like: a few passionate
  oldies who cant even put a website together). This also relates to other councils who are looking closely at what
  happens in Taranaki before formalising their own policies on land-based fossil fuel extraction.

  -Professional landing page for people wanting to donate to the court case which the group has launched. Donors 
  will see a sleek and beautiful website and feel increased confidence in their investment in the group as a result.

Metrics:

  -Increased local (taranaki) and national (NZ) traffic to site.
  -Increased public engagement. Includes clicks, social media shares, signing up to get involved and asking 
   for more info.
  -Increase in online donations over time.
