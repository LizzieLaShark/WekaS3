Taranaki Energy Watch Website

The website will provide an online landing page for the group; offering information, a chance to get involved 
& inspiring a feeling of community commitment against fossil fuel extraction in Taranaki.

Objectives:

  -Provide an informative and inspiring landing pad for taranaki community to be able to cut through council 
  proapaganda & gain understanding of the dangers of fossil fuel extraction in their community.
     -communication should be value based, backed up by robust science. Scientific resources should be linked to         rather than displayed on web pages.
     -Information about proximity of drill sites to schools and homes and why this is dangerous
     -Could include interactive map of area and significant danger sites?

  -Increase percieved power  
      -councils and fossil fuel companies understand that the opposition in Taranaki is quite large and
      is organised, full of xperienced grassroots activists (rather than what it currently looks like: a few             passionate oldies who cant even put a website together). 
      -Local councils outside of Taranaki should be able to see from the website that such movements are likely to
      arise in their areas if they follow the same course as Taranaki council.

  -Professional landing page for people wanting to donate to the court case which the group has launched. 
      -Donors will see a sleek and beautiful website and feel increased confidence in their investment in the group
      as a result.

Metrics:

  -Increased local (taranaki) and national (NZ) traffic to site.
  -Increased public engagement. Includes clicks, social media shares, signing up to get involved and asking 
   for more info.
  -Increase in online donations over time. 
  
(once the website has been live for ~4 weeks we will be able to make more specific measureables i.e. increase by x%
