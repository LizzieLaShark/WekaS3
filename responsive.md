RWD makes information accesible no matter what type of device or system is being used to access it. In a world of
smartphones tablets and portable technology, it seems like a no brainer that you'd want your site to work on all
the gadgets you can.

Main advanrages of a single, responsive site (rather than many) is around time it takes to code, only having one
code sheet to change if/when you do need to change things.

Native apps will ideally work perfectly all the time as you're only using the one device. Only have to build for that
single device/operating system etc.

My opinion is that we should use RWD wherever possible. For me working in the NGO sector this will be particularly
important. Many frontline communities live in countries where main access to internet comes through cellphones. 
I think designing 'native' apps doesn't take into account that some people dont have the option of using their laptop
or smartphone if your app doesn't work on whatever device they do have. It's kind of elitist in a way...
