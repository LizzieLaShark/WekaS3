I have a good friend who is blind, it's always been a pain when her screen reader can't use a program or 
read a website so I think that learning about accessibility is incredibly important. It has often struck 
me that her screen reader is often unable to function on programs that are widespread, even some google programs.

I've thought about accessibility for people who are either hard of hearing or seeing but it's not often 
that I've thought about people living with both of these things. The idea of developing programs that are 
compatible for people who use touch as their main form of communication is new to me and I'm curious to learn 
how we might adapt the things we develop to meet these needs as well.

I really enjoy learning about accessibility, I wish it were more of a priority for more developers as ignoring 
it really comes down to perpetuating a form of privilege.

I wonder if one issue is to do with time pressure from employers/clients. I think that ensuring your product 
has universal accessibility would be more time consuming and if this is not something your employer or the 
client values it could be hard to justify spending time on it. If this is the case then it's quite unacceptable
and we need to change the culture around that. Having this stuff incorporated into the EDA curriculum seems like
a really great start.
